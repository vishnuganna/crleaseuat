                <h2>Secure the growth capital your business needs</h2>
                <p>It can be challenging for small businesses to obtain small business loans for working capital from traditional lenders who typically require extensive collateral or other guarantees that the money will be repaid.</p>
                <p>To help small businesses overcome this challenge, VelocitySBA introduces the Working Capital Loan Program designed for loan amounts of $50K – $350K (typically 2x average monthly operating expense). The Working Capital Loan Program offers eligible businesses the flexibility of lower payments, longer term, and faster processing time (15 – 20 days).</p>
                <p>With a working capital loan from VelocitySBA, your business is better prepared to handle any immediate challenges or opportunities that may arise. You can maintain ownership and control of your business, and use the money however you see fit.</p>
